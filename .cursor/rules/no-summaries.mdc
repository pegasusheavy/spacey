# No Summary Documents

Do not automatically generate summary or recap documents.

## Prohibited Actions

- Do not create markdown files summarizing work performed
- Do not create "summary.md", "recap.md", "notes.md", or similar files
- Do not create documentation files unless explicitly requested
- Do not generate changelogs or release notes unless asked

## When Documentation IS Appropriate

Only create documentation when the user explicitly:
- Asks for documentation to be written
- Requests a specific document by name
- Asks you to "document" a feature or API

## Instead of Summaries

- Provide brief inline responses about what was done
- Use code comments for implementation notes
- Update existing documentation files when relevant
